### Sliver-automate 
 
This tool is designed to be a custom client to be able to select or "search" multiple beacons or sessions and run commands across all of them simultanously. Also, setup "triggers" to run commands on newly connected beacons. 

It is a "console" style tool with auto-completion and "?" syntax help.
